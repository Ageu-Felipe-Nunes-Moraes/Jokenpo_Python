# Jokenpo - Game Against the Computer

This project is an implementation of the classic "Jokenpo" game against the computer, written in Python. The game allows the player to choose one of the options and then compete against the computer, which will make its own random choice. The winner of each round is determined by the traditional rules of the game.

## Features

- **Play Against the Computer:** The player can choose between Rock, Paper, and Scissors to compete against the computer.
- **Random Delay:** To simulate the computer's thought process, there is a random delay before its choice is revealed.
- **Winner Verification:** The game automatically checks who won each round based on the game's rules.

## How to Play

1. When you start the game, you will see instructions on how to play.
2. You will be prompted to enter the number corresponding to your choice: Rock (1), Paper (2), Scissors (3), or Exit (0).
3. After making your choice, the computer will make its own choice after a simulated delay.
4. The result of each round will be displayed, indicating whether you won, lost, or it was a tie.
5. The game will continue until you decide to exit by entering 0.
